            <p>
              Hi there! My name is Prathamesh. I'm a Front End Engineer. I often
              make small but super useful automation scripts for web.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've 3+ years of experience in building tech products that served
              millions of users.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love teaching and helping people become better coders! In my
              spare time, I love to play outdoor sports games & listing song.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also like to make cool things with electrical devices. In terms
              of what I do, you might have seen me debug your colleagues code,
              ssh-ing a random server for no reason, teaching systems &amp;
              database design or play online chess.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can be your technical consultant and grow your business ðŸš€
              through the power of web.
            </p>
            <p>
